# Sudoku Solver

The Sudoku Solver can be run either using an executable file (written in C) or a Jupyter notebook (written in Python).

To use the C version, download and run sudoku-solver.exe and follow the prompts to input a puzzle.

To use the Python version, first download and open SudokuSolver.ipynb or open it online [here](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/chartung17/sudoku-solver/main?filepath=SudokuSolver.ipynb), then run the first code cell and follow the prompts to input a puzzle.
